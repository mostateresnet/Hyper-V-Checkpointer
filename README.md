# Hyper-V-Checkpointer
PowerShell script to automatically create and keep 4 weeks of rolling checkpoints. Designed to be used in conjunction with Task Scheduler.

Since this script doesn't really address the affects of the 1599/1600 bug, you should really consider using the Start-RollingBackups.ps1 script instead.
